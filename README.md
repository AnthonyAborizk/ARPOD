This repository aims to create an OpenAI compatible simulation of an autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking procedure for spacecraft. The simulation currently follows Clohessy Wiltshire equations in the local vertical local horizontal reference frame. It does not yet account for the attitude of the spacecrafts. 

This branch of the the repository fosuses on developing reinforcement learning models for the ARPOD proglem

The included code base was inspired by the following resources: 
1. The GitHub repo generated for [THIS](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.I011126) research. This code was used as a starting point for the ARPOD simulation and remains its backbone. 
2. [THIS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7798765) research focuses on methods to create a docking simulation accounting for all phases of the docking process. 
3. [THIS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amz.xcdsystem.com/A464D031-C624-C138-7D0E208E29BC4EDD_abstract_File22414/FinalPaperPDF_162_0923084819.pdf) research details the intended use of the simulation.
